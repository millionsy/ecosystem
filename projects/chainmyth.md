ChainMyth is a gaming ecosystem featuring characters as NFTs. It is a 5 v 5 multiplayer online game with two different game genres mixed, FPS and MOBA. As a gamer you would have always thought about using a specific hero’s ability or weapons in different games.

What we are accomplishing in ChainMyth’s gameplay will be a combination of CS:GO + DOTA. When you combine a shooting skill based game with strategy and magic spells for each hero, fun is beyond the limit. Our game’s theme and character’s superpowers are inspired from different mythologies such as Greek, Japanese, Chinese and Hindu gods/goddesses.

Three elements of the game will be Wind, Fire and Water. Manipulation of each element will cast a magic spell.

Monkey King/ Sun Wukong/ Hanuman is a popular monkey god among different mythologies. Hence used it as a main character to represent our NFTs and unlock the
remaining gods and goddesses in-game via NFT staking.
